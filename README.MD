Hello guys, this is me. Yes i am back from (Hell?). What i mean by hell is procrastinating stuff yet again. Yes i know im always like this. But now im back stronger than before. This is gonna be day 1 of learning react as i promised before. IDK whos reading this but well it doesnt matter. I do I.

Currently i have my thesis going on. But I realize something. Why can't i just do my thesis whilist studying. I got like so much free time a day and there is no reason to not study everyday. Its gonna be hard i know, but im sure i can do it. So lets just start and get into this.

Day 1: I dont remember

Learning simple terminal command:

1. cd = go to other folder (cd ..)
2. mkdir = make directory
3. pwd = give path to current directory

npx create-react-app {name} = to create react folder with everything you need already inside

Day 2 (or 4/5/6?): 0:00:00 - 2:59:04 (2 hours 33 minute of study)

## Small Diary

Im detoxing myself. When i said i will learn again everyday. Did i do it? Well as u can see, the answer is... not suprising "NO". Why you might asked? Do i do my thesis? Do i do something productive? The answer is always the same. I got no reason to not study. So i wanna get out of this situation and start detoxing for idk how long but i think im gonna detox for 2 weeks and even more depends on the situation.

What can't i do?

1. Play games (Besides Osu after doing my work). I know you guys might think that im half assing this thing but i don't really wanna talk about this to much. But im 100% serious. This choice is made after 3 hours of talking with my friend.
2. Watch Youtube for entertainment / Youtube shorts or the other same type of entertainment such as tiktok, reels, etc.
3. Watch anime and read manga / manhwa.
4. No you know what i mean.

This literally strip off all of my fun stuff. I can't watch anything while eating. I can't do anything entertaining. I really need this because i feel like all of that fun stuff needed to be removed to enhance my self control over these things. I want to be able to do this until i can feel satisfied without these fun stuff and focus on my life. So im gonna start studying now.

## What I learned today

For react to know that a function will be a component. REMEBER CAPITAL CASE ON FIRST LETTER

I think thats enough for today, what i learned today? A lot and i can't remember it all i think but i get the gist of it. But i still dont understand something so im gonna try and watch the part of video which i dont understand tomorrow. See you later

Day 3: 40 minutes of study (2:44:29)

Today, im going to understand what i write yesterday and im gonna write it here. So feel free to correct me if im wrong because i still dont understand the connection between the props thingies.

First of all, i have Friend component, And inside the parameter we can pass "props". props is an object???. Yes now props is an object. So at the FriendList function, if i write <Friend number = "1"/> Then the props will have parameter of number with value of 1. The video called this "number" a property then so be it.

So the next is deconstructing. From what i know, the props will store multiple property, and with desconstructing, i can simply seperate those things using const {bla, bla2, bla3} = props. So bla will contains the value of bla written in the Friend in Friendlist. We can also destructured staight in the parameter, so just pas the bla inside the Friend function parameter.

So then, using map method, we can seperate the object that has a keys inside into seperate things.

// Rules
// return single element
// fragment <React.fragment> / section / div
// camel case for html attribute
// className instead of class
// close every element

Back to day 1: 3:23:43 (1 Hours 36 Minute study)

Its 10:21 now. Im going to study now. First i need to review first.

Its 14:26 now. I just finished reviewing things. It took long because i gotta do some other important stuff. But now im back to the part where i left before and i already understand maybe 98% of the material. Ill continue.

Its 16:33 now, I know i just study for a while, i guess studying in my friend's house is not the most efficient thing to do. Well see you guys tomorrow. Oh about what new things i learned today. Its about event, simply when we click a button or hover our mouse into the thingies, it just do something. And i also learn import export which is pretty straightforward. See you tomorrow.
