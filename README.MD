Hello guys, this is me. Yes i am back from (Hell?). What i mean by hell is procrastinating stuff yet again. Yes i know im always like this. But now im back stronger than before. This is gonna be day 1 of learning react as i promised before. IDK whos reading this but well it doesnt matter. I do I.

Currently i have my thesis going on. But I realize something. Why can't i just do my thesis whilist studying. I got like so much free time a day and there is no reason to not study everyday. Its gonna be hard i know, but im sure i can do it. So lets just start and get into this.

Day 1:

Learning simple terminal command:

1. cd = go to other folder (cd ..)
2. mkdir = make directory
3. pwd = give path to current directory

npx create-react-app {name} = to create react folder with everything you need already inside
